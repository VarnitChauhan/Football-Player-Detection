# ⚽ Football Player Detection & Information Retrieval

This is an **AI-powered Streamlit web app** that detects **professional football (soccer) players** from uploaded images, retrieves detailed information using **Google Gemini API**, and provides **voice output** using `gTTS`.

The project combines **computer vision**, **generative AI**, and **text-to-speech** technologies for a smooth, interactive experience.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Face Detection** using OpenCV's Haar cascade (largest face selection).
- ✅ **Player Identification & Info Retrieval** using Google Gemini AI.
- ✅ **Detailed Player Info** including:
  - Full Name
  - Nationality
  - Club
  - Position
  - Achievements
- ✅ **Voice Output** of player details using Google Text-to-Speech (`gTTS`).
- ✅ **Streamlit Web UI** for easy interaction.
- ✅ **Bounding Box Visualization** around detected player face.

## Running the App

Run the Streamlit app locally:
streamlit run app.py

---

## How It Works

Upload Player Image → User uploads a football player's image.

Face Detection → OpenCV detects the largest face.

AI Recognition → Google Gemini analyzes the image and retrieves player details.

Bounding Box → A green rectangle is drawn around the detected player's face.

Voice Output → gTTS generates an MP3 audio of the details.

Display Output → Image, text, and audio are displayed in the Streamlit app.

## Possible Improvements

Add multi-face detection for group photos.

Integrate live webcam support for real-time detection.

Improve name accuracy with fine-tuned AI prompts.

Save detected results in a database for history tracking.
